### Technical Implementation

#### Drag and Drop Logic

The project uses `@dnd-kit` to implement Trello-style drag-and-drop functionality for moving task cards between columns.

```ts
const handleDragEnd = (event) => {
  const { active, over } = event;
  if (!over || active.id === over.id) return;

  const oldColumn = findColumnByCardId(active.id);
  const newColumn = findColumnByCardId(over.id);

  if (oldColumn && newColumn) {
    moveCardBetweenColumns(active.id, oldColumn, newColumn);
  }
};
