## 🚀 Introduction

During my internship at a tech company, I used Git every day — not just for basic commands, but also for real-world situations that required flexible handling.

This post shares a few specific scenarios I encountered, how I dealt with them, and some handy tips to work with Git more effectively and professionally.

## 🧩 Scenario 1: In the middle of a task, got pulled to fix a hot bug

### 📝 Description

You're halfway through coding on the branch `feature/task-A`, when your team lead messages:

> "There's a critical bug in an old feature. Please fix it ASAP."

### ✅ How to handle it

```bash
# 1. Temporarily save your current changes
git stash

# 2. Switch to another branch to fix the bug
git checkout feature/task-B

# 3. Fix the bug, commit, and push as usual

# 4. Switch back to your original task
git checkout feature/task-A

# 5. Retrieve your stashed work
git stash pop
```

<Tip>
Always double-check before using `stash pop`, as it might lead to conflicts if the same files were modified in both branches.
</Tip>

## 🧩 Scenario 2: Too many small commits in a branch

### 📝 Description

You made several small commits while working on a task, like:

```bash
feat: build UI
fix: padding issue
refactor: split component
```

Now you want to clean things up before pushing.

### ✅ How to handle it

```bash
# Combine the last 3 commits into one
git rebase -i HEAD~3
```

Mark the secondary commits as `squash` or `s`, and write a clean commit message.

<Tip>
Always squash your commits **before** opening a pull request to keep your Git history tidy!
</Tip>

## 🧩 Scenario 3: Can't push code — asked to pull first

### 📝 Description

You commit changes and try to push, but get this error:

```bash
error: failed to push some refs
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
```

### ✅ How to handle it

This means the remote branch has new updates that you haven't pulled yet.

```bash
# Pull latest changes from remote
git pull --rebase

# Then push your changes
git push
```

<Tip>
Use `--rebase` to avoid unnecessary merge commits and keep history clean.
</Tip>

## ✨ Wrap-up

Git isn’t just about running `add`, `commit`, and `push`. It’s a powerful tool for collaborating in teams. When you run into real-world issues, you'll pick up practical skills and understand Git on a deeper level.

Hope these examples help you navigate Git more confidently at work! 💪
